## Hackathon Oct 2024
As introverts who like tennis, we want to make it easier for people to find friends to play with.
Users can mark their availability and location on a real-time interactive map, showing when and where they will be on a public tennis court.
As nerds who like tennis, we would also like to use computer vision to track our progress in the game over time, and automate scoring and matchmaking.
